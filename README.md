# Conf.app

Hey! 👋 So I built this thing called Conf.app, a social network for conferences. It's still a work in progress, so suggestions and PRs welcome!

## What's the deal?

I wanted to create a space where conference attendees could hang out, share ideas, and have some fun. You know, the usual: meet new people, learn some stuff, and maybe even discover some new music.

## Features

- 📅 Conference schedule
- 🍔 Local recs: food, entertainment, live music, and architecture
- 🤔 Trivia based on conference talks
- 🏆 Badges and achievements
- 📹 Photo and video uploads
- 🎵 Link user spotify profiles to discover new music from conference attendees
- ❤️ Add your own feature - we love PRs!

## Personal Promo (ew)

- Buy me a coffee on Ko-fi ☕️
- Hire me on my portfolio and GitHub

## Contributing

Ask me questions in an issue, or just open a PR - if you're adding new libraries please open an issue first!
